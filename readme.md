# Codeclan Week 02 Day 03

## Multiple Classes, Interactions & Class Diagrams Full Day Lab

## Topics to be covered today:

* Applied Class interaction & composition of prior knowledge

## Full Day Lab - Pub Modelling

You task is to model a Pub using Ruby.
The Pub Will need Customers, Food, Drink to interact with. Design the Classes

Stick to your principles:

* Always start on paper with the screen off
* Take breaks or the screen will turn your eyes to fudge
* Test first, make it fail, code it to pass, test again, commit THEN refactor
* Keep your variable names tight
* Watch the console
* Remember, you always want to test first and FAIL, this lets you know your passes are solid.

This time you'll also need to include a class diagram using UML as part of the process.

## Notes



### Order of approach:

* Write it down on paper first - split it up into attributes and behaviours, understand what needs built.
* Create Class Diagram utilising UML detailing classes & interaction
* Set up directory, spec files and source code files, create Git repository and get that first commit in.
* Begin with the classes which have zero dependencies and then work your way up.
* Get your test requirements, file requirements and headers down then draw down from MiniTest to create test class.
* Create setup data in each test file to be used - create an @object of each class necessary to be tested.
* Create class in source file. Create initialize method.
* Begin creating test functions, let it fail, then code it to pass.
* Commit once passed. Keep a record, keep it clean.
